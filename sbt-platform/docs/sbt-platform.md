# The Platform sbt plugin

**sbt-platform** is a SBT plugin that aims at simplifying the maintenance
and release of Scala Platform modules. It automates common use cases to
speed up developers' workflow and let module maintainers focus on the essential.

Add it to your project (`project/plugins.sbt`) with:
```
addSbtPlugin("ch.epfl.scala" % "sbt-platform" % "0.2.0")
```

The `sbt-platform` plugin provides a tight integration with the Scala Platform CI
server and infrastructure. For now, it covers the following use cases:

* Automatic release of nightlies.
* Automatic release of stable versions when a git tag is found.
* MiMa compatibility checks and PGP signatures for artifacts (with Scala Platform keys).
* Integration with our Drone setup for writing your own sbt scripts.
* Automatic detection of cumbersome sbt keys (e.g. `scmInfo`).
* Automatic configuration of common sbt plugins:
    * `sbt-bintray`
    * `sbt-pgp`
    * `sbt-release`
    * `sbt-mima-plugin`
    * `sbt-coursier`

Together with [our CI](ci-integration.md), the plugin aims to provide a complete
developer experience with good error detection.

## Next steps

As `sbt-platform` is still *work in progress*, we're open to suggestions
on improving Scala Platform modules' maintainers. Our potential next steps are:

* Adding support for Sonatype.
* Releasing to more than one Maven/Ivy repository (Scala Platform's and your personal one).
* Extending the default release steps for every process.
* Adding release processes for release candidates and milestones.
* Adding smart test execution based on changes in git commits, i.e. instead of
running `sbt test` for all the projects, run it only for the affected subprojects.
* Improving MiMa binary compatibility checks.
* Adding source compatibility checks using Scala Meta.

If any of the previous features calls your attention, feel free to help out and make a PR.
`sbt-platform` follows the same [CONTRIBUTION](https://github.com/scalacenter/platform-staging/CONTRIBUTING.md)
guidelines than the Scala Platform process.

> {.note}
> We hope to improve the infrastructure and the maintainers support as the Scala Platform

## Usage

`sbt-platform` defines two main commands:

| Platform | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|releaseNightly | Release a nightly version of the module. |
|releaseStable | Release a stable version of the module. |

### Examples of use
```
releaseNightly [release-version <version>] [skip-tests] [cross]
releaseStable [release-version <version>] [skip-tests] [cross]
```

All the arguments are optional and `<>` represents the parameters.

Release commands are executed by the CI. To set it up, check
the [CI documentation](sbt-platform.md).

## Setup

`sbt-platform` already comes with a default setup, thought out to get
you started as soon as possible. You only need to make sure that 
[the integration with the CI works](ci-integration.md).

However, you may find interesting changing the value of some sbt keys.
The general syntax for this is:

```scala
nameOfSbtSettingOrTask := {
  // Write here Scala code that returns a value
  // according to the type of the settings or task
}
```

### Common general settings and tasks

This section includes the most important settings and tasks of the sbt plugins the `sbt-platform` depends on.

| Settings | Description | Type | Default |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---- | ---- |
|bintrayRepository | Name of the Bintray repository the artifact will be stored on. | `String` | N/A |
|bintrayOrganization | Name of the Bintray organization the repository is in. | `String` | `"scalaplatform"` |
|publishArtifact in Test | Setting to include the test sources in the final released artifact. | `Boolean` | `false` |

| Tasks | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|bintraySyncMavenCentral | Sync bintray-published artifacts with maven central |


### Platform-specific tasks and settings

Aside from reusing the settings and tasks defined by the dependent sbt plugins,
`sbt-platform` defines their own to make easier customize the plugin functionality.

### Platform-specific settings

| Settings | Description | Type | Default |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---- | ---- |
|platformInsideCi | Checks if CI is executing the build. | `Boolean` | `false` |
|platformCiEnvironment | Get the Drone environment | `Option[CIEnvironment]` | `None` |
|platformReleaseOnMerge | Release on every PR merge.| `Boolean` | `false` |
|platformModuleName | Name of the module and the bintray package.| `String` | bintrayPackage.value |
|platformModuleTags | Tags for the bintray module package.| `Seq[String]` | bintrayPackageLabels.value |
|platformTargetBranch | Branch used for the platform release.| `String` | `"platform-release"` |
|platformGitHubToken | Token to publish releases to GitHub.| `String` | N/A |
|platformReleaseNotesDir | Directory with the markdown release notes.| `String` | `baseDirectory.value / "notes"` |
|platformSignArtifact | Enable to sign artifacts with the platform pgp key.| `Boolean` | `true` |
|platformPgpRings | Files that store the pgp public and secret ring respectively.| `Option[(File, File)]`| N/A |
|platformBeforePublishHook | A hook to customize all the release processes before publishing to Bintray.| `Task[Unit]` | N/A |
|platformAfterPublishHook | A hook to customize all the release processes after publishing to Bintray.| `Task[Unit]`| N/A |

### Platform-specific tasks

| Tasks | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|platformValidatePomData | Ensure that all the data is available before generating a POM file.|
|platformCurrentVersion | Get the current version to be released.|
|platformLatestPublishedVersion | Fetch latest published stable version.|
|platformPreviousArtifacts | Get `mimaPreviousArtifacts` or fetch latest artifact to run MiMa. |
|platformNextVersionFun | Function that decides the next version.|
|platformRunMiMa | Run MiMa and report results based on current version.|
|platformGetReleaseNotes | Get the correct release notes for a release.|
|platformReleaseToGitHub | Create a release in GitHub.|
|platformActiveReleaseProcess | The active release process if `releaseNightly` or `releaseStable` has been executed.|
|platformNightlyReleaseProcess | The default nightly release process.|
|platformStableReleaseProcess | The default stable release process.|

## Release processes

The release process setup relies on [sbt-release](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-release)
and follows the [Scala Platform release process](https://github.com/scalacenter/platform-staging).
By using it, modules maintainers can be sure that their practices are valid according to
the spec.

### Platform Bintray repositories

The Scala Platform uses Bintray to store and release all the Scala modules artifacts. Bintray allows
maintainers a fine-grained control over their releases and provides instant release time and synchronization
with Maven Central. The [Bintray Scala Platform](https://bintray.com/scalaplatform) organization owns the following repositories:

1. [releases](https://bintray.com/scalaplatform/releases) - Stable releases (and, in the future, milestones and RCs).
1. [nightlies](https://bintray.com/scalaplatform/nightlies) - Nightly releases.
1. [tools](https://bintray.com/scalaplatform/tools) - Scala Platform maintainers' tools.

### How nightlies work

The Scala Platform bot is executed every night and takes care of:

* Releasing a nightly of every module of the Scala Platform.
* Warning when:
    * Binary compatibility is broken;
    * Version is invalid;
    * Tests don't pass; and
    * Bintray upload failed.
    
In case something goes wrong, notifications are sent via email / Gitter / Slack.
Nightly releases are available in [nightlies](https://bintray.com/scalaplatform/nightlies).
    
### Stable releases

To cut a stable release, tag the `platform-release` branch with the appropiate
version number and push. When Drone finishes, your release will be available
in [releases](https://bintray.com/scalaplatform/releases).

#### Decide the version number for stable releases

You're free to choose the version number of the library as long as the bumped number
is consistent with the Scala Platform version your module is targeting.
If the latest Scala Platform release was `1.2` and the next one
is `1.3`, then your stable version is only allowed a minor bump (e.g. `2.3` => `2.4`, `1.1` => `1.4`).

### Decide the Maven coordinates {#maven-coordinates}
    
When releasing stable versions, module maintainers can decide the group id
of their maven coordinates. For instance, already existing organizations or
individuals may want to preserve their credit in the official artifacts
they release.

To enable our infrastructure to release to Maven Central, you need to:

* Give deploy access to the user `scalaplatform` in Sonatype by either:
    * Opening a [Sonatype JIRA issue](https://issues.sonatype.org/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?issuetype=21&pid=10134) asking to give deploy rights to `scalaplatform`; or
    * Manually adding `scalaplatform` as a deploy user with [the Nexus UI](https://books.sonatype.com/nexus-book/reference/confignx-sect-managing-users.html).
    
We suggest you to go with the first option. Here you have a [useful video](https://youtu.be/P_3yo-oU1To)
in case you're lost.

> {.note}
> Make sure that the organization setting in sbt is set to your desired group id.
> Ultimately, this is the option that sets the Ivy and Maven path.
    
### Modify the release process {#modify-release-process}

The simplest way to modify the default release processes is to use
`platformBeforePublishHook` and `platformAfterPublishHook`.
For instance, let's register a new GitHub release for every nightly,
but only after publishing to Bintray (disabled by default).

```scala
platformAfterPublishHook := {
    val logger = streams.value.log
    val active = platformActiveReleaseProcess.value  
    if (active.exists(platformNightlyReleaseProcess.value)) {
      logger.info("Cool! Nightlies are now released to GitHub.")
      platformReleaseToGitHub.value
    }
}
```

The previous code checks that the active release process, set when either
`releaseStable` or `releaseNightly` is run, corresponds to the defined
nightly process and if so creates a release in GitHub, along with your
markdown release notes (if any).

### On further extensions
`sbt-release` provides primitives to write release processes from scratch:

1. `releaseStepTask` - Run an individual task. Does not aggregate builds.
1. `releaseStepTaskAggregated` - Run an aggregated task.
1. `releaseStepInputTask` - Run an input task, optionally taking the input to pass to it.
1. `releaseStepCommand` - Run a command.

Use them if you want to extend the release process with input tasks, or any
other feature that requires more fine-grained control.
When you are finished, set your new release process to `platformNightlyReleaseProcess` or
`platformStableReleaseProcess`.
